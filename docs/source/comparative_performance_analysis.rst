Comparative Performance Analysis
================================
A vital step in determining the viability of the RCM layer was finding situations where it outperformed the Dense layer. 
By analyzing "when" and "why" these situations occurred, we were able to figure out the exact strengths and weaknesses of the RCM layer. 
We created a set of rigorous tests, each with the same amount of parameters and epochs, in order to guarantee that extraneous factors would not influence model performance. 
These tests were designed to measure the RCM layer's performance in all possible use-cases of a Dense layer, to ensure an even comparison between the two architectures.

We will start by explaining the testing process, then present our preliminary na√Øve prediction of the RCM layer's performance, and conclude by analyzing the results of the tests.
