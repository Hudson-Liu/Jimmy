Project Structure
-----------------
This project is organized into 6 primary directories:

1. ``docs``: All documentation for the webpage goes here.
2. ``examples``: A few basic examples of using the RCM layer are located here
3. ``rcm_layer```: The primary RCM Layer library is contained here. 
   This includes a Keras implementation of the RCM Layer concept, alongside a visualization toolkit, 
   allowing for the easy creation of complex visualizations of the RCM layer. 
4. ``misc_scripts``: Programs that are referenced throughout the documentation documentation, 
   but aren't directly related to the RCM Layer itself, are put here. For instance,
   a proof of *layerless supremacy* would go here, as it's not directly related to
   the RCM layer, but also serves an important role in the documentation.
5. ``models``: Models created as a result of the example programs are saved here.
6. ``tests``: Unit tests used to verify the functionality of the RCM Layer library are placed here.
