**RCM**: Recurrent Complete Multidigraph

# Examples
The examples supplied in the "examples" directory are a useful tool for understanding the abilities of the RCM layer.

**If you have the RCM-Layer package installed to PATH:** You can just directly execute any example via a simple `python -m [example_name]`.

**If you _do not_ have the RCM-Layer package installed to PATH:** If you just cloned the RCM-Layer repo and didn't install it to PATH via pip, you'll have to either:
- Open CMD, use `cd` to enter the directory of your RCM-Layer installation, then run  `python -m ./examples/[example_name]`.
- Open VS Code and select the "Run \[example_name]" debug configuration.

In both cases, calling the examples from the package-level is essential, as this triggers the `__init__.py` file that then asserts the PATH of the RCM-Layer package.
